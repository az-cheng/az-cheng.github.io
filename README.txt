This is my personal website, first developed during a class at Cornell University, ENGRC 3025 Creating and Communicating Your Digital Professionalism. Thanks to Dr. Hutchison for giving me useful feedback.

As I am looking to become a professional in strategic management and consulting, my intended audience are potential employees. I would like to demonstrate my resourcefulness, well roundedness, initiative, communication skills, as well as professionalism through the website.

Some of the contents are still work in progress. I appreciate any feedback to make the website better!
