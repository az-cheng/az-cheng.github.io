  <h2>Cayuga Medical Center Emergency Department Process Improvement</h2>
</header>
<p>

  <b><font size="+2"> Overview </font></b><br>
  In collaboration with Cayuga Medical Center (CMC), a 212-bed hospital employing over 1,500 healthcare professionals and 200 affiliated physicians, we embarked on a project to optimize their Emergency Department (ED) process flow, focusing on improving patient wait times and service quality. The primary objective was to identify potential bottlenecks and opportunities within the existing ED process flow, specifically targeting ESI 3 patients, who typically experience the longest wait times.<br> <br>

  <b><font size="+2"> Problem Statement </font></b><br>
  CMC's ED faced several challenges, including long patient wait times, patients leaving before being seen, inefficiencies in patient throughput, unidentified bottlenecks, and decreased capacity. The project aimed to assess the current operations of CMC's ED and the triaging of patients according to the 5 ESI levels, with a focus on ESI 3 patients, and implement process improvements to alleviate these issues..<br> <br>

  <b><font size="+2"> Deliverables </font></b><br>
    We provided CMC with a final report, including the following components:<br> <br>

    <b>1. Process Flow Mapping: </b>We created a high-level process flow map for ESI 3 patients, from intake through exit, highlighting potential bottlenecks and critical paths.<br> <br>

    <b>2. Patient Intake and Triage Best Practices Overview:</b> We summarized ED intake and triage best practices and identified gaps based on interviews with key stakeholders.<br> <br>

  <b><font size="+2"> Expected Benefits </font></b><br>
  Our project deliverables enabled CMC to identify ED bottlenecks for ESI 3 patients, understand current industry best practices for ED intake and triage, and consider potential adjustments to address bottlenecks and triage. These improvements aimed to increase throughput and reduce wait times for patients, ultimately enhancing the overall patient experience.<br> <br>

  <b><font size="+2"> Conclusion </font></b><br>
  In conclusion, our collaboration with Cayuga Medical Center on this project demonstrated the importance of effective process analysis and optimization in healthcare settings. My contributions to the project, including process flow mapping and the identification of best practices for patient intake and triage, played a vital role in addressing the challenges faced by CMC's Emergency Department. As a result of our joint efforts, we were able to pinpoint bottlenecks, develop targeted recommendations, and implement improvements that significantly reduced patient wait times, particularly for ESI 3 patients. This project showcased my ability to work collaboratively with healthcare professionals and apply my analytical skills to generate tangible, positive outcomes that enhance the overall patient experience and streamline operations within a critical healthcare environment.<br> <br>
