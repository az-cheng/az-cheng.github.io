  <h2>Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment:
    One-time Disposed vs. Reprocessed Masks
</h2>
</header>
<p>
  A Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is conducted in this project. LCSA aims to <b>bring to light the hidden or unexpected impacts</b> on the environment during the sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, and consumption of products. LCSA relates to the <b>three pillars</b> of sustainability: <b>environmental, economic, and social</b>.
  <br><br>
  One benefit to the use of LCSA is to have a consistent approach to address the many environmental issues, dismiss the many <b>“environmental folklores”</b> we currently have, and give our well intended “trying to do the right thing” a credible scientific support. With science-based goals, we can ask the right questions to drive innovation, have closed loop systems and product service systems, achieve long-term value creation, and account for hard-to-measure intangible value.
  <br><br>
  One challenge to the use of LCSA is to structure and make use of the interdisciplinary models to address the various types of environmental life cycle problems. Throughout scientific research, it is crucial to derive <b>consistent criteria</b> for implementing methods that carefully and thoroughly address such life-cycle based questions. It is not easy to elaborate the LCSA framework given a plethora of different approaches and methods, but collaboration across countries, sectores, businesses, and people would certainly help.
  <br><br>
  Here is an interesting TED Talk by Leyla Acaroglu, who talks about role of LCSA in bringing hidden or unexpected impacts to light.

  In Spring 2022, I took the class BEE3299 that explores LCSA. I conducted a project that evaluates the sustainability of <b>one-time disposed vs. reprocessed masks</b>. This study mainly addresses the healthcare system in the U.S. where we see an ongoing need for face masks before and during the pandemic. Hospitals are an ideal starting point to experiment the implementation of reprocessed masks. By going through the life cycle stages including production, use, and end-of-life, we found that the reprocessed masks are indeed a better option across all pillars, likely due to its greater success in protecting the same group of healthcare workers using less overall materials. You can find more about the project and how LCSA applies in this specific setting in the below deck as well as the final report attached.
