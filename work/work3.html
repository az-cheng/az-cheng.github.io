  <h2>Aircraft Maneuver Recognition on Flight Test Data of C919</h2>
</header>
<p>
  <b><font size="+2"> Background </font></b><br>
  During the summer of 2021, I interned at <a href="http://english.comac.cc/" target="_blank">COMAC </a> (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) flight test center in Shanghai. The company is the largest airplane manufacturer in China. It was a great opportunity to engage in the industry, make use of my skills and take them to the next level.<br><br>

  I conducted the research of <b>“Aircraft Maneuver Recognition.” </b> The maneuvers include circling, climb turning, rolling, as well as stalling. We used a variety of machine learning tools that identify specific data patterns correspond with such maneuvers. Here is a cool video showing the 90 degree rolling maneuver during test flight:

  <b><font size="+2"> Model training </font></b><br>
  Trained on massive data with over hundreds of features, we were able to eventually build a model with very high precision. It was a breakthrough in the field of flight testing. Our model saved a huge amount of time for the test engineers by automating the important step of maneuver recognition, which further enhanced safety of flight testing.

  <br><br>During the process, I worked alongside experienced researchers and learned about using <b>dimensionality reduction</b> and <b>feature engineering</b> to process the data. Then, I independently applied <b>support vector machine (SVM)</b> models to the data. Here is a table combining the final results of precisions corresponding with the different algorithms.<br><br>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Algorithm</b></td>
      <td><b>Dataset 1</b></td>
      <td><b>Dataset 2</b></td>

      <td>SVM (Support Vector Machine)</td>

  <b><font size="+2"> Takeaways </font></b><br>
  In addition to the analysis, I saw the effort taken to manage a project like this on a large scale: how to <b>communicate</b> goals and expected outcomes from engineers to researchers, how to <b>deliver data</b> in <b>secure</b> ways, how to put all the different components together while <b>keeping up with the timeline</b>, and how to effectively present the results. I put up proposals of improving the infrastructure of the company using <b>network optimizations</b> and eventually some of my suggestions were adopted by the department. I am always looking to make a positive impact for the environment where I am in and I found it so rewarding.

  The below paragraph is quoted from my supervisor of this internship:<br><br>

  <blockquote>"Annie is smart, motivated, and hardworking. It has been a pleasure to work with her during the summer of 2021. She has demonstrated strong analytical skills towards a specific goal within the bigger picture. Her keen sense in business strategies also sets her in good place to become a leader."  -- Director Liu
