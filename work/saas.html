  <h2>SaaS Platform for Integrated Transit Solutions</h2>
</header>
<p>

  Our Cornell Graduate Consulting Club (CGCC) project focused on assisting a startup company with a comprehensive <b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> platform designed to revolutionize the transit business. The platform integrated functions such as route optimization, cargo tracking, driver tracking, and more, aiming to streamline operations and enhance efficiency in the industry. <br><br>

The client sought to raise funds for their product and approached CGCC to create a compelling pitch deck that included market size, competitor landscape analysis, and the unique advantages of their SaaS platform to attract potential investors. <br><br>

Throughout the project, our team: <br><br>

<b>1. Collaborated closely with the client</b> to understand their business priorities, ensuring that our recommendations aligned with their long-term strategy and vision for growth and success.<br><br>

<b>2. Analyzed the client's profitability structure</b> using cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis, identifying areas for improvement and presenting recommendations for different products. Our efforts resulted in a significant increase in contribution margins by 27%.<br><br>

<b>3. Conducted competitive benchmarking, industry best practice, and market research</b> on last-mile delivery service platforms, identifying the client's niche market and providing valuable insights for their strategic decision-making. <br><br>

<b>4. Crafted a compelling visual narrative</b> that effectively communicated the client's financial performance, growth potential, and market positioning to potential investors. We developed visualizations for a pitch deck that aimed to raise 3 million dollars in funding. <br><br>

<b>5. Proactively managed project timelines and deliverables</b> to ensure the team met project milestones and deadlines while maintaining a high level of quality in all deliverables. Our team members demonstrated strong leadership skills by mentoring junior team members, providing guidance on project tasks, and facilitating productive team discussions. We fostered a collaborative team environment throughout the project. <br><br>

By leveraging our expertise and working closely with the client, we were able to deliver valuable insights and recommendations that set the foundation for their fundraising efforts. The project showcased the potential of the client's SaaS platform to revolutionize the transit industry, ultimately attracting investor interest and contributing to the company's long-term success.<br><br>
