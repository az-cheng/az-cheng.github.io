  <h2>Air Taxi Implementation in NYC: <br>A Promising Transportation Revolution</h2>
</header>
<p>

  Air taxis, or electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, have the potential to transform urban transportation by <b>offering a fast, efficient, and convenient alternative to traditional methods</b>. New York City (NYC), notorious for traffic congestion and its aging infrastructure, presents a prime opportunity for the introduction of air taxis.<br><br>

  <b><font size="+2"> Background and Analysis </font></b><br>
  In this project, we analyzed the feasibility of implementing air taxis in NYC. Using data from the New York City Taxi Trip Data from UIUC Data Bank, we estimated the demand for air taxis and assessed the viability of incorporating this new transportation mode. Our findings indicate a substantial potential for air taxis in NYC, with an estimated daily demand of 3,650 trips and a payback period of just five years.<br> <br>

  We also identified key challenges and future research directions for the development and deployment of air taxis in the city. As demand for air taxis grows due to increased urbanization, the need for alternative, fast, and efficient transportation modes becomes more apparent.<br> <br>

  <!-- <b> - Data pre-processing - </b><br> -->
  <b><font size="+2"> Implementation and Challenges </font></b><br>
  To accommodate the estimated demand, we determined that 20 vertiports and 100 eVTOL aircraft would be required, with a payback period of five years. Our calculations considered operations and maintenance costs, battery and charging, and pilot and insurance expenses. With an estimated revenue of <b>$321M</b>, cost of <b>$210M</b>, and profit of <b>$111M</b>, the net profit margin is <b>35%</b>.<br> <br>

  However, challenges such as accurately estimating demand by time of day, day of the week, and seasonality must be addressed to optimize operations and maximize profits. Additionally, realistic considerations for vertiport construction, such as site location, feasibility, and zoning regulations, must be factored in. <br><br>

  <!-- <b> - Model training - </b><br> -->
  <b><font size="+2"> Future Directions </font></b><br>
  In order to better understand the feasibility of air taxis in NYC, we plan to develop a simulation that includes aircraft rebalancing and other factors to optimize performance and profits. Furthermore, we will explore the potential of combining air taxis with other transportation modes, such as subways, buses, CitiBike, or Uber, to provide passengers with a diverse array of travel options. <br> <br>

  <!-- <b> - Discussion - </b><br> -->
  <b><font size="+2"> Conclusion </font></b><br>
  Our analysis suggests that the implementation of air taxis in NYC has strong potential for success. With an estimated daily demand of <b>3,650</b> trips and strategic vertiport placement, air taxis could serve as a <b>fast, safe, cost-effective, and profitable</b> transportation option in the city. As a crucial component of future urban mobility, eVTOL aircraft will contribute to a <b>system optimization</b> that seamlessly connects all modes of transportation. By providing urban residents with safe, fast, and sustainable options, we can help pave the way towards a future vision of <b>mobility as a service</b>. Further research on demand prediction and implementation costs will be vital to realizing the full potential of air taxis as a transformative solution to urban transportation challenges, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of life in our cities.
