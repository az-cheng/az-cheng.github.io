  <h2>Stonemason and Nun</h2>
</header>
<p>
“My sweet girl, it’s time for bed.” My Grandma lay by my side, and patted my back softly. The city lights in the high-rise apartments were still bright and the honking sounds of the cars were still loud at night in this Chinese city. I could see the strings of my Grandma’s gray hair under the dim light. The red laces and cloudiness in her eyes announced her tiredness. She always wanted to dye her hair black, but I thought her gray hair looked cool and stylish.<br><br>
“No, no! One more story, please.” Like the naughty girl I was, I insisted.<br><br>
“Alright, just one more.” I knew my Grandma would never refuse my yearning request.<br><br></p>
<i>
In a village far far away, there were many memorial archways. They were usually two stories high, made of limestone and had a color close to gray. You can feel the grooves of the cold stones when you touch them. They were never torn down, and the oldest one was said to be five hundred years old.<br><br>
Among the stonemasons in the village, there were three classes: the lowest class built tombstones or graves, the middle class built stone bridges, and the highest class built stone archways. When I was young, one of the most exciting things was to see the stonemasons building an archway. It was a rare thing, but when it happened, everyone came to watch. There were always candies to eat and cards for kids to play.<br><br>
Later on, I learned that the archways were almost built exclusively for women...... dead women. All the memorial archways honored these women for dying widowed or unmarried, so they were also called chastity archways. Though there were countless rural widows, only very few of them could have chastity archways built, which required a series of demanding steps. Not even the chief of the family or the chief of the village could decide whether to build one or not. The family of the dead women must report it to “the squire guild” of the province, which consisted of the most knowledgeable and reputed men.<br><br>
The stories about these women were always mysterious. For example, one time my parents told me about an engaged couple who had never met before, and when the woman had heard of the news that her fiancé was dead, she immediately committed suicide. Or, when a man proposed marriage to a woman who was just widowed, she hanged herself to show her loyalty to her late husband. Of course, it was a rich family thing. The poor ones wouldn’t be able to afford to build an archway.<br><br>
One day, an ambitious young third class stonemason decided to track down Mr. Pan, the most reputed first class stonemason to ask for an apprenticeship.

<p>
<br><br>
“Wait, I know Mr. Pan! Doesn’t Grandpa have a picture of him in the living room?”<br><br>
“Yes, yes, and you’ll know him better once I finish my story......”<br><br>
</p>
<i>After the young man had waited by Mr. Pan’s front door for a whole afternoon, he caught sight of an old man with a stick in his right hand limping forward, as if his next step had a hard time connecting to the one before. That was Mr. Pan. He had been walking for a whole day to build archways for another village. The shadow of the sun staggered down the mountain, in contrast with its bright mood in the morning.<br><br>
The young man introduced himself and then sat down on the cornerstones as Mr. Pan gestured. Mr. Pan gave him a familiar feeling, as if they had met before.
I am also a stonemason, the young man said. But I’m only making gravestones, not as prestigious as you.<br><br>
Mr. Pan rubbed his chin and waited for a moment. You’re a mason, too? he said. Follow me to Shannan town tomorrow. I will need some help.<br><br>
The young man was so excited. He didn’t expect everything to go so smoothly and that Mr. Pan to accept him so quickly.<br><br>
He immediately nodded, saying, yes, I’ll follow you, and I’ll listen to you.<br><br>
On the way to Shannan town the next day, the young man kept talking to Mr. Pan about his experience in becoming a stonemason and his understanding of the archways. He talked enthusiastically, while Mr. Pan only nodded his head once in a while. Finally, the young man decided to ask the question that had been lingering in his mind.<br><br>
Mr. Pan, all these years you’ve built countless archways. I presume most of them were for young girls?<br><br>
Yeah.<br><br>
Oh, the poor little girls. I first chisel their graves, and then you set them free. The young man said.<br><br>
Set them free? Mr. Pan asked. What do you mean?<br><br>
The young man hesitated, and said, you have made a memorial for them, so they are in heaven.<br><br>
In heaven? Mr. Pan shook his head and said, I couldn’t do such a thing. Suicide is suicide.<br><br>
But the graves that have a memorial for them are always empty. What other explanation would you give other than that they have flown away? the young man said.<br><br>
Pan suddenly turned around, held the young man’s hand and asked. What? The tomb is empty? How do you know that?<br><br>
The young man was panicked by this question. Every time when he finished building a grave, there were grave thieves who threatened him into telling the tricks of cracking open the key of the grave. He never asked where the bodies went, as long as he was paid a generous amount. However, as long as it was a suicidal young girl who had a memorial archway built for her, the grave thief claimed that the body was gone. As time went by, the young man concluded that all the girls had risen to heaven. But that was just speculation, and he wanted a confirmation from Mr. Pan.<br><br>
Did you go to the grave? Mr. Pan asked.<br><br>
No, but I heard it from the grave thieves, the young man explained.<br><br>
Empty? Mr. Pan stopped and sat down on a big stone by the side of the road, talking to himself. He looked up again and asked the young man, when the burial took place, are you sure the coffin had been put in?<br><br>
I was there. It must have been put in. Her whole family was crying.<br><br>
The coffin is not empty? he asked.<br><br>
How should I know? But from the look of it, it carries weight, the young mason said.<br><br>
Pan pulled out a smoke from his waist and lit it.<br><br>
A few moments later he said, I have encountered some strange things during my years of building the archways, and I have not been able to understand...... Empty in the grave? How could that happen...... The Taoist priest once said that it is the soul that rises to heaven, not the body. Where did the body go......<br><br>
After smoking, they got up and headed for the town and, step by step, went to build another memorial.
</i>
<p>
<br><br>
“I know, I know! The young man is Grandpa!”<br><br>
“Yes, you smart girl.”<br><br>
“And what happens next? Did the bodies actually fly away?”<br><br>
“Enough story for one night. I’ll tell you something else tomorrow. Goodnight.”<br><br>
The second night, my Grandma told me a different story from her childhood.<br><br></p>
<i>
There was once a Buddhist nunnery in the village where I grew up. However, by the time I was born, there were no more nuns in the temple. China was going through wars, and there was no government giving the nunnery supplies. However, when I was nine, three beautiful Buddhist nuns came to the nunnery. No one knew where they came from, but they decided to build an elementary school and become teachers. Before they arrived, the boys in the village had to wake up at five in the morning and climb over two mountains to go to school in the neighboring town.<br><br>
At that time, because I was the oldest in my family, I was already helping my parents take care of my young siblings, carry out daily chores, water the crops, and feed the cow. I didn’t think I had a chance of going to school until the three teachers came. Why could only boys go to school and not girls? Am I destined to follow the path of all the other women in the village: to marry a man when I turned eighteen, and then probably hang myself when he died to get my name forever printed on a memorial archway? No. I wanted to be educated. I wanted to have the same learning opportunities as the boys.<br><br>
I knew my parents would never allow me to follow my dreams. So one day, I brought with me some red bayberries that I plucked from my family farm, and visited the three teachers.<br><br>
After I waited by the teachers’ front door for a whole afternoon, I caught sight of them, walking gracefully. They were so pretty. Their long hair reached their waists and their warm smiles melted the snow in that cold winter. They had been teaching for an entire day, but they were still so energetic. The setting sun kindled the sky and lit up the mountains with baby pink and crimson red, in contrast with its gloomy coldness in the morning.<br><br>
I introduced myself, and the teachers welcomed me into their house. They gave me a familiar feeling, as if we had met before.<br><br>
I am Huiyun and I live in the bungalow with my parents and three younger brothers right across the river, I said. Here are some bayberries for you if you would allow me to go to school.<br><br>
How cute you are, Huiyun! The teacher with the red dress laughed like a jingling bell with her right hand covering her mouth. The three of them exchanged glances. Then the teacher in a blue dress bent down, held my hands, looked into my eyes and said, come to the nunnery tomorrow and find first the classroom one on your left! Now may I have a bayberry?<br><br>
I was so excited. I didn’t know that everything could go so smooth and the three teachers could accept me so quickly. I immediately nodded, saying, yes, I’ll come tomorrow and I’ll work hard.<br><br>
So I became the first girl in my village to go to school. It became a legend that were told for years. More girls joined me afterwards. When I went back to the village from time to time, the oldest people would still refer to me as the “first schoolgirl.” I did my best to learn as much as I could during my time at the nunnery. My dream was to leave the mountain village and become a teacher. I did leave, and I came to this city.</i>
<p><br><br>
“Are the three teachers still there? Do you ever go back and visit them?”<br><br>
“No, they died a few years ago......”<br><br>
“And where did they come from? How come they were pretty and educated but were willing to teach at such a remote place?”<br><br>
“Oh, you curious child. I don’t know all the answers. A story is a story. Time for bed!” My Grandma yawned. While she tucked me in, her wrinkled skin and dry fingers tickled my neck. She turned off the lights, kissed my forehead, and whispered “sweet dreams.”<br><br>
But I could not fall asleep. This was such a fascinating story and there were so many details that didn’t quite make sense when I deliberated on them. Maybe my Grandma just made it up. Maybe the three pretty teachers never existed. But wait. A sudden idea rose into my mind and stirred my heart.<br><br>
I imagined...... one winter night when there was no light but the light from the moon and no sound but the blowing of the wind and the running of the water. A young girl boarded a boat. Her mother and father waved goodbye to her. You couldn’t hear their voices, because they tried not to wake anyone. You could only see the teardrops from the mother’s eyes. It was the last time they would see each other. The young girl was going down the river to escape marrying a man she didn’t love and the old feudal doctrines. The river set her free.<br><br>
The first beam of sunrise of the following day was telling the story of <i>The Roster of Missing Women in Chinese History</i>. However, this roster contains the secrets of the mountains, rivers, and time. It leaves no trace, but is forever remembered by the archways in a remote village, the bayberries in a farm, and flowers in a nunnery.<br><br>
It is also remembered in the stories of my Grandma, and in my Grandma herself -- for now I see she was one of the girls that came from the mountains and rivers.<br><br>
I carry the spirit of the Buddhist nuns and my Grandma in my veins. Now, twenty years later, I look out the window of the cockpit and I see the northern lights, as if the spirits of my ancestors are flying to heaven.<br><br>
