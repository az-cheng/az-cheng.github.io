  <h2>What Makes Us Human?</h2>
</header>

<p>
  In the winter of 2022, I took an online class named "What Makes Us Human?" by Professor Uriel Abulof. From freedom to love, from truth to happiness, from death to religion, I was able to reflect upon my own experiences and tried hard to find the answers. Here I document my thoughts and growth along this journey.

Week II: Morality, God & religion, alienation & love, hope

Human/nature

It’s interesting how we think we are unique, or better, compared to animals. However, we found that animals have emotions, rationality, and even mirro recognition the same as humans. If so, what makes us unique? I’m thinking, maybe the ability to form languages to convey precise and abundance of ideas and feelings can be part of the answer. Even though many other animals also have their own languages, only human languages consist of signs and symbols. So we can form abstract ideas from them. We can also learn from previous scholars through such language and continue to develop civilizations and technologies that no animal can because of it.

In addition, I really enjoy watching the clips from Game of Thrones and House of Cards. According to Machiavelli, “the purpose of politics is the acquisition and maintenance of power through deceit and fear.” According to Lord Baelish, it is about “climbing a ladder by stepping down on others.” According to Max Weber, “politics is a public struggle over power and power is the capacity to have your way despite resistance.” These sayings hit home and make me reflect upon stories I heard about in real life. It seems like such pursuit in politics and power go against humanity. But these things inevitably happen and affect our everyday lives. Will I be able to avoid becoming such a “homo politicus” adult while still becoming who I aspire to be?


Identity & authenticity

I found the discussion of the difference between essentialist and existentialist very interesting. For essentialists, essence precedes existence, and that our purpose is to find our core and follow the predestined path. For existentialists, on the other hand, existence precedes essence, and they believe in determining our own destinies and creating our own paths. Am I leaning towards a more essentialist or existentialist view? I pondered about the question several times and still cannot land on a precise answer. A lot of times I echo with the existentialists. I believe the power I have at hands in choosing my own path and determining my future. I believe the efforts I make to fulfill my goals have a meaning and would do good to the world. However, other times, when I am feeling down and losing control, the essentialist view comes to mind. I wonder who I am at core and the meaning of things I pursue. And at these times, discovering my innate nature and knowing there is a path for me to follow helps relieve the stress and regain my confidence.

No matter what, the most important thing is to be authentic. Then comes the question: what is authentic? The clip showing Alex’s reaction to the gunman elicits the question of which one is his authentic self, the one who hides behind his fiance or the one steps ahead to face the rifle? This moment challenges Alex’s “ontological security” and makes him lose his stable mental state of self and reality. Indeed, our instincts often betray us and reveal a self that we do not believe in or we do not like. For example, I used to believe myself to be a highly self-disciplined person, even at times I would still procrastinate and cram before the deadlines, I tell myself it’s just this one time and next time I will plan things ahead and stick to my plans. But one day, I wake up and find myself always procrastinating, always submitting assignments on the due date and even using slip days more often than I imagined, and not doing high quality work as I did before. My sense of self cracked at that moment. But authenticity is to look at the situation with honesty. Only when I admit that I procrastinate can I actually start making a change.



Freedom & Liberty


I really like the discussion about the difference between freedom and liberty. Oftentimes we use the two words interchangeably, but they actually entail different meanings. As Rousseau said, “Man is born free, and everywhere he’s in chains.” The first half of the phrase is about freedom as choice, while the second half is about liberty as control.

However, we might fall into the trap of bad faith, or “philosophical suicide” as we talk about freedom. We must distinguish I choose from I must, and I refuse from I can’t. The picture above shows how we say “I can’t” by giving away our freedom to choose. This is dangerous and goes against existentialist belief of always having the courage to choose. For example, coming to Cornell for college was a choice I made for myself. Even if sometimes I would think I did not have a choice because this is what my parents would expect and what the society wanted as Cornell is an ivy league school. But in fact I still have the final say. I knew coming to Cornell would be more challenging and it’s located in a small town, I still made the choice and I would have to take the responsibility to adjust to the environment and finish my degree here. It’s not that I must accept Cornell’s offer, it's that I chose to accept Cornell’s offer.

In the end, we face the burden of freedom because we must take responsibility and understand individuality. That’s the source of the Church’s power because God can tell us what is the right thing to do. We ask for freedom, but we also give away our own sense of control willingly. This is a dilemma that everyone faces.


Reflection

While freedom is the key to unlocking liberty, reflection is the key to freedom. With reflection, we navigate our emotions and hear our inner voice. Our consciousness and conscience come out of it, which is indeed the birthplace of freedom. The story of Dorian Gray particularly hits me. He thought the picture could absorb all his dreadful sins so he himself could remain young and beautiful. But indeed, his true self actually exists in the picture. When he kills the sinful person in the picture, he kills himself. Dorian Gray lacks self reflection and critical thinking. He sells his soul for beauty and everything eventually comes back to himself. That is the banality of evil.

I ponder on the discussion of self reflection and perspective thinking. Without reflection, we follow orders from others and only comply. I grew up in a traditional Chinese family. Being compliant and following orders were good virtues valued by my family. I was taught to be a good kid, follow orders from parents at home and teachers at school. I guess to some extent “behaving well” indeed helped me to get good grades and avoid dangers. Being liked by others also opened opportunities for me. However, on the other hand, I do find my creativity was lacking. When I first came to the U.S. for high school, I hated being asked for my own opinions or being in group discussions because I did not know what’s the right thing to say. Slowly I came to realize that oftentimes there is no right or wrong answer. I had to be true to myself, reflect, be able to conduct critical thinking and formulate my own thoughts. It took me a while to adapt to this new ideology but now I’m a lot better at it. Now I write journals, I meditate, I talk to my friends to express my genuine and honest thoughts. These are ways for me to reflect and I feel free.















Happiness

In the TED-Ed, the question “would you opt for a life with no pain?” has been asked. We’ve also talked about this question in class. This thought experiment with the experience machine is based on the idea of hedonism and maximizing net pleasure. However, in real life, even though the pursuit of happiness is natural to everyone, there’s more to it. Truth, knowledge, and authentic connection are many times more important than simple pleasure. On the other hand, in the video we discussed whether money buys happiness. The answer is no. Money can only buy life satisfaction but not happiness, which is evidenced by the Easterlin Paradox. There’s also the hedonic treadmill which states that the tendency of humans to return to a baseline stable level of happiness after big changes. Moreover, studies have shown that inequality in society greatly contributes to the level of happiness. Denying our inevitable death is also impeding our pursuit of happiness.

When I was young, my parents were always busy at work. Other kids would have their parents take them to the amusement parks or zoos at weekends but mine didn’t. Their “excuse” for neglecting the connection between us and not participating in my life was that they had to make enough money and give me a good enough material foundation so that I can be happy. That’s not true. I have longed for authentic connection with people. Now I’m a senior in college. When I plan for my career and future, I would not let the amount of money made to be the most important standard. I would go for something I truly enjoy doing and find meaning from doing it.



Death

Recently, I've been watching a Chinese drama called Reset. It talks about the protagonists being trapped in a cycle of the day, where both of them are killed on a bus that explodes. However, when they die, they begin the day again. They tried a lot of things to avoid death, but barely worked. During one of the cycles, they found the person that carries the bombs. They got into a fight on a bus, but they were killed by that person. It reminds me of “freezing” that was talked about in the video when people face terror and death. At that moment in the drama, other passengers on the bus, though they are good people and have their own stories of trying hard to live, none of them stood up to help fight the person carrying bombs. They all freezed. They became indifferent bystanders and couldn’t stand up for justice. The situation felt so real but you can hardly blame them. It’s human.

However, it’s important that we still have this awareness of death awareness because “only by contemplating death can we fully embrace life.” In the drama, the protagonists died in many different ways. Sometimes in a dream before that they hardly feel anything. Sometimes brutally painful that they have to desert the other passengers that they promise to save. The fear of dying and also wanting to die become so tangible. Luckily in the drama they have a second chance, even many many chances, to do something different and try to avoid death. In real life, however, when you die you die. You cannot reset and cannot relive.
Meaning

In the poll section, I see that 43% of students in the class select loneliness as the thing that fears you the most, including myself. Seems like I’m not alone:) When I’m with my friends, going out for food or for a movie, I feel like everything’s all good and the future is bright. However, when I’m by myself for too long, such as during this pandemic, that a lot of times we have to restrain social interactions, I feel lonely. When I wake up in the morning and see that it’s another day staying inside in this cold weather, I don’t want to get up. When it’s lunch time and there’s no one waiting to have lunch with me, I don’t have lunch. When it’s just me in the apartment, I don’t want to tidy up my room or the kitchen because no one will see. What’s the meaning? I have tried to enjoy this alone time and do things I enjoy, such as playing the piano, doing puzzles, watching tv shows, as well as, of course, taking this class, but I still could not fulfill it. I want my roommate to come back and accompany me. I want my boyfriend to be by my side. I miss my pets at home far away on the other side of the world. I want to share my happiness and sadness with people who would understand. But it’s been so hard.

If I share these thoughts with my mom, who is a total utilitarian, she would just say, “why think? Just do. When you make yourself busy, you’ll forget loneliness. It’s just an illusion.” It might be absurd searching for meaning in this meaningless universe, but we still have to ask why. I even think it’s the opposite from my mom’s opinion. I think loneliness, fear, and emptiness are the truth of life. Pleasure and happiness are only fleeting and are illusions. But it’s so sad to think about it and the truth can be too cruel. Just like Trump said, “I don’t like to analyze myself because I might not like what I see.” I feel touched by the little girl saying “You’re our only Abu Ali.” I also wonder, what is life good for?









Truth & Trust

Misinformation and fake news are all over social media. In the beginning of the pandemic, it was filled with news about how the virus was not real, or there was no use of wearing masks, or even injecting bleach as suggested by Trump. The misinformation without being fact checked did not help to control the spread of the virus, but also killed lives of people. Politicians are in a place to create realities. It’s the “truthiness” that they seek -- what feels to be true rather than what the fact will support. However, it’s interesting how living within the lie sustains the system and hides its disgrace. Otherwise, the truth can corrupt the system.

This brings out the discussion of freedom of speech. On one hand, it seems that freedom of speech is so necessary that we can say two and two make four, and that we can express different opinions and still be heard. On the other hand, however, it might be the case that too much freedom of speech would bring harm. Fake news is one example. Words can also be used to libel and mislead the public. Sometimes I wish we had one authority that would punish those people who say things that would hurt so that those people cannot use freedom of speech as their escape. But certainly this approach might go awry as such “authority” can use this power for no good.

Not all lies are bad. Luckily we have “artistic lies that hit at deeper truth,” such as fiction and movies. These would stimulate our critical thinking and give insight to truth. On a similar note, a person seeking the truth should always ponder about the implications under the given situation. For example, when a wife caught a husband cheating, she would say, you lied to me. However, the deeper truth might also be problems within their marriage that have existed for a long time. Therefore, when a wife says, I trust you, it might not necessarily be that she doesn’t know the truth. It might just be that she chooses to ignore it so that it wouldn’t hurt so bad. After all, “living within the lie sustains the system and hides its disgrace.”


Morality

“His control depends on our choice”.
My mom’s control over me is not my choice. Maybe not when I was younger, but now, I have a choice. I still allowed her…
What if you were born a slave?
Legitimacy -- bad faith
“Legitimation loop”

I found this phrase empowering, “His control depends on our choice.” This is an example of the “legitimation loop,” which says we obey someone because we believe it’s legitimate, while it’s only legitimate because we obey it. It also coincides with “bad faith” we discussed earlier in this course. Oftentimes we say “we must” instead of “we choose to.”

I personally have undergone a period of taking responsibility and making my own choices. I have lived in the dorms during both middle and high school. However, in middle school, I was in my hometown in China, where it was a top down structure and students barely had a say over what should be done in the dorms. The RAs had all the power for the bureaucratic rules in the dorms, in the name of “military management,” and that they could punish people easily. We complained a lot in private, but no one barely fought back. When I came to high school, however, it was different. There were also rules, but it seemed like there were not so black and white and there was room to argue. For example, if I’ve been behaving pretty well all along but missed breakfast check in once, I would not get a punishment right away but instead be asked about the context of the situation. I slowly learned to express my opinions on the rules of how to make the dorms a better place. In my junior year, when I found a dorm parent being quite biased towards certain groups of students, I even stood up for the group and he resigned the role in the dorms. His control was indeed dependent upon the choice of the students. The act of “impeaching” a dorm parent was unimaginable in my middle school. I wonder how I got here. Maybe I grew up and became braver in standing up for myself and asking for my rights, so that I was able to desert “bad faith” and become “free.” But it also might be that the environment changed. I was simply able to adapt to the new environment that allowed me to choose who’s in control.

If we turn to the history of slavery, it would be even harder to argue that “His control depends on our choice.” The slaves never chose to give power to their masters. It was so hard to fight back and stand up for themselves. Even now slavery was abolished, the situation might not necessarily have been better. Most of us have experienced being under the control of our parents. Did we choose who to be our parents? No. But since they are our parents, they have a say. It’s lucky that many of us are able to gain control for ourselves when we grow up, but it’s also the case for many others who could never gain such control. Who to blame? The individuals or the society? Nature or nurture?


God & Religion

(

My favorite science fiction novel is “The Three-Body Problem” written by Liu Cixin. He suggested in the novel that the destiny of humans is to develop technologies as best as we can, to fight the intellectual beings in other galaxies, to fight against our destiny to become extinct, and seek a way to last, even beyond the lifetime of our own solar system and galaxy.
)

I was raised as an atheist. I believed in science, and science tells that there’s no god. So I didn’t believe in God. Given I went to an episcopal school and went to church every week, I developed some understandings for the Bible, but I still believed religion as a means to give solace and guidance at times, but not as something that was “true.” Then, my sister married a Christian, and she raised her two kids as in this Christian family. When I talked to her from time to time, she would tell me how Christianity helped her to face challenges in life. I observed my little niece praying before going to bed, saying, “I fought with my little brother today. God told me it was not the right thing to do. I shall love him and do good to him.” I was so touched how she was able to reflect and improve even at such a young age. Since then, I’ve been paying more attention to religious beliefs and trying to understand the stories in the Bible. I’m still not a religious person. However, I do believe that there is some higher order being that’s above us humans. Maybe it’s God, or not, I don’t know.

I often ponder upon the origin of the universe and the destiny of our human race. I’m amazed by the intricacy and beauty of the universe, and especially, Earth, how lives were born on Earth. In the Big Bang, what’s the chance that all elements were created with just the right amount so we have our universe today and that it’s still expanding. It’s hard to believe that everything happens with coincidence. It feels like there’s an invisible hand that’s in control of everything. This past fall semester I took the class, Introduction to cosmology. I learned that even though we have gained a lot of knowledge of the universe, many important questions are still left unanswered. Though I believe in science, I also start to think there’s more to it. Would religion give at least part of the answers?

On the other hand, what I see in religion is that it’s often used for political purposes. People in power use it to legitimize themselves and control their followers with their own interpretations of religious texts. I hate to see how the world is so divided not only because people have different beliefs, but more so that the majority was used by the purposeful minority with the so-called religion to achieve goals that are not universal. A lot of times religions did not prevent wars, starvation, poverty, and disease, but instead foster those. I would say we should practice religion with caution. If we do good, that’s awesome. But if people harm, or self harm, and become more divided, then not so good. Once again, it’s hard to say what’s good or bad. There’s no definitive answer. God might know it all.


Alienation & Love


Modernization, globalization, and the pandemic have made humans become ever more alienated. In the past, I have always travelled home during winter break. Not this time. There have not been many flights available in the first place. And if I go back, I have to undergo a 14+7+7 = 28 days of quarantine, which pretty much takes up the whole duration of winter break. Geographical dislocation has indeed brought mental isolation. I’ve been talking mostly to my friends on phones. Talking to a device, instead of a real person, has been the way of communication and we all adapt to it. In the midst of all this, I tried not to be self-alienated. I’ve been trying to understand myself, make peace with myself, and love myself. This course has greatly helped me in this process and I appreciate it. I also have to be cautious, yet again, to avoid becoming “amour-propre” but instead should be “amour de soi.” It’s so easy to compare myself with others in this high level of peer pressure. I should be more compassionate.

I’ve also been thinking love being the answer to such alienation and loneliness. An important realization is that love is about “meaning-making.” We try to see in our lovers’ eyes if they love us. We often evaluate our self worth in this way. But the truth is, love is very likely a disillusionment. We love beauty, money, and knowledge instead of the person themselves. We love companionship and how we are not alone in the world. But “making meaning in this meaningless world” is itself absurd. In addition, we often exchange freedom for love. Love remains not of choice but of control as shown when Winston says, “I love Big Brother.” Sometimes I think: it’s too hard to love a person, instead it’s a lot easier to love animals, like cats -- they are always loyal, and they have abundance of time to accompany. Then I realize the underlying notion is that it’s too hard to control a person but it’s easier to control an animal. I’ve told myself “don’t get hurt this time.” It didn’t work. I still get hurt. Sometimes I feel like when I love a person wholeheartedly, I become weak and it’s easy to lose myself. But I still fall knowingly and willfully, as long as it lasts. My religious sister would say to me, “Don’t seek love from others. Love yourself. Then love them. And God always loves you.” Maybe when you have a belief, you’re fulfilled inside and become stronger.

Hope
I have come to learn that, if we pursue truth and meaning, then it would be hard to pursue happiness. If we pursue love, then it would be hard to pursue freedom. If we want to be human instead of machine-like or dog-like, then we will have to suffer and be tormented anew. But hope is that “fire inside” that keeps us going. It’s both a blessing and a curse. It gives us the pleasure of anticipation but also the fear and anxiety of not seeing our hope realized. “While I breathe, I hope.” The world is still full of possibilities, as many as the number of stars in the night sky. Quantum physics and multiverse theories give me “hope” that there’s a better version of myself exists somewhere in the universe, some time in the future.

As for the few questions being asked, such as “love someone who doesn’t understand you,” or “love without measure,” or “forgiving,” I feel like I’ve seen such love in books and movies, but hardly in real life. I’m not capable, not yet at least. I’m a secular person and not a superwoman. I’m still hoping to find someone who understands me, feels me, never hurts me, and falls in love, again. It’s a hard journey. But I choose to try, to see the best in them and help them live up to it. There’s still so much more to do to “become worthy of our distinct humanity.”
