  <h2>Two Pigeons</h2>
</header>
<p>
Once, there was a little girl. Her grandma bought her two pigeons.  <br>
 <br>
They were beautiful, full of hope. She built them a nest on the balcony. They were smart. She let them out during the day, and they knew the way to come home by dusk. They were free. She watched them with curiosity. She touched them cautiously. She loved them with her whole heart, and they trusted her, unconditionally.  <br>
 <br>
Grandma told her, “One day, they will lay eggs. After 18 days of hatching, a baby pigeon ought to be born. New life will born.”  <br>
 <br>
So she waited and waited. Finally, one morning, when she almost forgot about waiting but went to check on the pigeons as her daily routine, she saw the two eggs.  <br>
 <br>
She was exhilarated. She held the eggs in her hands, felt their warmth, and freshness. So pristine. So treasured.  <br>
 <br>
Immediately, she wanted to share this joy with her grandma. Still with the two eggs in her hands, she turned around and began running.  <br>
 <br>
Boom.  <br>
 <br>
Eggs dropped. Smashed on the ground. Yolk flowed out, like blood, all over the place. She froze. Then, the whole building heard her screaming, and crying. She killed them.  <br>
 <br>
Her pigeons flew away and never came back. <br>
 <br>
She never had pigeons. <br>
