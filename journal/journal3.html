  <h2>Two Yellow Leaves</h2>

<!-- <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> -->
<p>
Sitting under a shine of sunlight, <br>
Nice, warm, but not too bright. <br>
Listening to the waterfall at Cascadilla George, <br>
Peace and ease, day and night. <br>
 <br>
A yellow leaf falls from lofty heights, <br>
Whirl spinning into the fast rushing creek, <br>
Soon out of sight. <br>
Follow the stream. <br>
Follow the strea. <br>
Carrying down by the nature's mighty might. <br>
 <br>
The flow of water runs through the woods. <br>
They bend, they curve, <br>
They go freely without rules. <br>
Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, <br>
Most often fell, less often rose, <br>
But they always on the road and never hold. <br>
Flow, flow, <br>
Go with the flow. <br>
A bright future ahead unfolds. <br>
 <br>
Another yellow leaf caught my sight. <br>
She is so ordinary, awaits neaby. <br>
She has a rough texture, as well as marks and dots, <br>
Like an old lady with wrinkles that are easily caught. <br>
She's far from youth and beauty, <br>
But she has stories. <br>
Stories of rains and lightening, <br>
Stories of winds and time. <br>
She's so pretty the way she is now. <br>
She's so unique that compares to nothing else. <br>
She makes my day, as I myself embrace. <br>
 <br>
The two yellow leaves, <br>
One I'll forever cherish, <br>
One has gone away. <br>
I move on with joy, <br>
And pray. <br>
