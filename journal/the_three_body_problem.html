  <h2>The Three-Body Problem and Human Nature</h2>
</header>
<p>
Not long ago I had a discussion with a friend about human consuming meat. We talked about how we eat meat historically, and how we are on the top of the food chain and has power over other species on this planet. However, there are many arguments in recent year about how a vegan way of life is healthier and more sustainable. Here I do not intend to go into much detail about this debate. I want to use this as a cornerstone to talk about one of my favorite novels of all time -- "The Three-Body Problem" by Liu Cixin, and ask: What is human nature? And how do we live our lives? <br>
 <br>
In the novel, there is a character named Mike Evans, who is a believer of “Pan-Species Communism” and a leader of the Adventists faction of the organization ETO. He tries to save every endangered species possible. He believes “all lives are equal”, and humans are never at the top of the Great Chain. Interestingly enough, the thing that drove him to this belief is his utter despair of human nature, which stemmed from the mass extinction of species caused by modern civilization. He and his believers eventually hated humans and tried to seek hope in alien civilizations. <br>
 <br>
On the other hand, another faction of ETO is called Redemptionists. They hold a different view of human nature. They think: human civilization has been so lonely in the vast desert of the universe. We’ve been trying to find aliens because we don’t want to be alone. We have imaginations and find pleasure in such anticipation. Different from the Adventists view, they still have hope in human nature, but they also think we can’t do it alone. I found the people in the book might at core share similar stands to people with religions in real life, but instead of believing in God, they believe in extraterrestrial intelligent beings. <br>
 <br>
The settings in “The Three Body Problem” shed light on our discussion of human nature. In the novel, people in one faction often look down upon the other ones and tried hard to protect their own beliefs. We often grapple on the ideas of the “self” and the “group.” It is human to seek our own identities that place each of us in the different bins of gender, nationality, race, age, as well as religious or non-religious beliefs. There is often ambiguity and controversy. It also happens that we don’t fit in any of the bins. We want to “belong” because we don’t want to be “alone.” The struggle of constantly seeking is  real. <br>
 <br>
In one of the classes I took in the fall, the big messy data, we talked about “fairness” in data analysis. Often in a dataset that’s related to people, we have the “protected attribute,” which is defined as a feature in which discrimination is prohibited, or, the “bins” that we define ourselves with. In data analysis, we would define a classifier as “unaware” of the protected attribute if the prediction is independent of it given other covariates. Then comes the discussion of when we want to achieve this unawareness and when we do not. The bias we bring and the ethics we hold have significant societal implications. We must be more aware of our obligations to the society at large. Specifically, how our models affect the protected attributes is quite important. But it is hard to make a standard fairness metric for all. For example, in some cases, considering unawareness might reduce the accuracy of our model. Indeed, judging a person based on their gender, race, age, and nationality might be our human nature, regardless of whether it is the right thing to do. This will then lead to the question of whether we want artificial intelligence to make decisions “like humans,” or make the right decisions “for humans.” <br>
 <br>
The novel has also presented a situation where people's mind and beliefs could be controled by a thought machine. In the real world, we don't have such a machine. However, sometimes we do abide to “bad faith” in that we lack objective judgement but instead abide to whatever someone else dictates. How much should we trust the government and how much should we stick to our own libety and individualism? On one hand, we need a stable society to effectively produce goods and services. On the other hand, we need liberty to express our own critical thinking and keep those of power in check. While I was in China a few years ago, all students who were in K-12 education had to fluently recite the “socialist core values,” including patriotism and democracy, freedom and equality, harmony and justice. Now when I think about those things, they are contradictory at essence. <br>
 <br>
Will we ever find an answer to these never-ending questions? Towards the end of the novel “The Three Body Problem,” what keeps Cheng Xin going in the endless loneliness of searching for truth is love. When I first read about this, I felt like such a profound book turned into a cliche. But then, when I read the book again and again, I started to understand Cheng Xin and the love she represents. Love is about affection, attraction, attachment, about passion and compassion, loyalty and belonging, soulful and pleasurable. It is a way to answer the hard questions more intuitively and personally rather than reflectively or philosophically. Love is about healing. It also brings hope, and fear. It has to be the answer then. The song of the Singer Civilization goes like this (please forgive my unskillful translation): <br>
 <br>
I saw my lover <br>
I flew to her <br>
I took out the gift <br>
A piece of solidified Time <br>
Beautiful stripes on Time <br>
So soft as the mud of a shallow sea <br>
She painted Time all over her body <br>
She pulled me up and flew to the edge of existence <br>
A spiritual flight <br>
The stars in our eyes were ghosts <br>
We were ghosts in the eyes of the stars <br>
