  <h2>Waking to the Green</h2>
</header>
<p>
It was St.Patrick's Day three days ago. So many people were wearing green across campus. The clock on the top of Cornell Chime also turned green. I bought a hat with a shamrock at Cornell Store with the hope that it will bring me good luck. Everything seemed so nice on this sunny day. So I took some time to reflect on my relationship with religion. <br>
<br>
I was raised as an atheist. I believe in science, and science tells that there’s no god. So I didn’t believe in God. Growing up, I went to an episcopal high school, I had friends who are religious, I took classes in the religion department, and I started to develop some understandings for the Bible. Then, my sister married a Christian, and she raised her two kids as Christians. When I talked to her from time to time, she would tell me how Christianity helped her to face challenges in life. I observed my little niece praying before going to bed, saying, “I fought with my little brother today. God told me it was not the right thing to do. I shall love him and do good to him.” I was so touched how she was able to reflect and improve even at such a young age. Since then, I am learning more about religious ideas and trying to understand the how and why. I’m still not a religious person. However, I do believe that there is some higher order being that’s above us humans. Maybe it’s God, or not, I don’t know. <br>
<br>
I often ponder upon the origin of the universe and the destiny of our human race. I’m amazed by the intricacy and beauty of the universe, and especially, Earth, how lives were born on Earth. In the Big Bang, what’s the chance that all elements were created with just the right amount so we have our universe today. It’s hard to believe that everything happens with coincidence. It feels like there’s an invisible hand that’s in control of everything. This past fall semester I took the class, Introduction to Cosmology. I learned that even though we have gained a lot of knowledge of the universe, many important questions are still left unanswered. Though I believe in science, I also start to think there’s more to it. Would religion give at least part of the answers? <br>
<br>
On the other hand, what I see in religion is that it’s often used for political purposes. People in power use it to legitimize themselves and control their followers with their own interpretations of religious texts. I hate to see how the world is so divided not only because people have different beliefs, but more so that the majority was used by the purposeful minority to achieve goals that are not universal. A lot of times religions did not prevent wars, starvation, poverty, and disease, but instead foster those. It's heartbreaking to see people harm, or self harm, and become more divided. What's the way out? There’s no definitive answer. God might know it all.<br>
